description: How to prepare your app to use StimulusReflex
---

# Setup

StimulusReflex relies on [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org/), an excellent library from the creators of Rails. You can easily install StimulusReflex to new and existing Rails projects.

```bash
rails new myproject --webpack=stimulus
cd myproject
bundle add stimulus_reflex
bundle exec rails stimulus_reflex:install
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The terminal commands above will ensure that both Stimulus and StimulusReflex are installed. It creates common files and an example to get you started. It also handles some of the configuration outlined below.

If you already have an existing Rails project or don't want to run a generator, you can add Stimulus to your project with `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:stimulus` and `yarn add stimulus_reflex` to install the Stimulus Reflex client library.
{% endhint %}

## Configuration

Update your Stimulus configuration and make sure that stimulus\_reflex is in your Gemfile:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="app/javascript/controllers/index.js" %}
```javascript
import { Application } from 'stimulus'
import { definitionsFromContext } from 'stimulus/webpack-helpers'
import StimulusReflex from 'stimulus_reflex'

const application = Application.start()
const context = require.context('controllers', true, /_controller\.js$/)
application.load(definitionsFromContext(context))
StimulusReflex.initialize(application)
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Gemfile" %}
```ruby
gem "stimulus_reflex"
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
StimulusReflex attempts to locate the existing ActionCable consumer but will establish a new web socket connection if the consumer isn't found.
{% endhint %}

Rails 6+ applications should explicitly register the ActionCable consumer:

{% code title="app/javascript/controllers/index.js" %}
```javascript
//...
import StimulusReflex from 'stimulus_reflex'
import consumer from '../channels/consumer'

//...
StimulusReflex.initialize(application, { consumer })
```
{% endcode %}

You should also add the `action_cable_meta_tag`helper to your application template so that ActionCable can access important configuration settings:

{% code title="app/views/layouts/application.html.erb" %}
```markup
  <head>
    <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
    <%= csp_meta_tag %>
    <%= action_cable_meta_tag %>
  </head>
```
{% endcode %}

### Authentication

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're just experimenting with StimulusReflex or trying to bootstrap a proof-of-concept application on your local workstation, you can actually skip this section until you're planning to deploy.
{% endhint %}

Out of the box, ActionCable doesn't give StimulusReflex the ability to distinguish between multiple concurrent users looking at the same page.

**If you deploy to a host with more than one person accessing your app, you'll find that you're sharing a session and seeing other people's updates**. That isn't what most developers have in mind!

When the time comes, it's easy to configure your application to support authenticating users by their Rails session or current\_user scope. Just check out the Authentication page and choose your own adventure.

{% page-ref page="authentication.md" %}

## Logging

In the _default_ debug log level, ActionCable emits particularly verbose log messages. You can **optionally** discard everything but exceptions by switching to the _warn_ log level, as is common in development environments:

{% code title="config/environments/development.rb" %}
```ruby
# :debug, :info, :warn, :error, :fatal, :unknown
config.log_level = :warn
```
{% endcode %}

Alternatively, disabling just ActionCable logs _may_ improve performance.

{% code title="config/initializers/action\_cable.rb" %}
```ruby
ActionCable.server.config.logger = Logger.new(nil)
```
{% endcode %}

## Troubleshooting

{% hint style="info" %}
If _something_ goes wrong, it's often because of the **spring** gem. You can test this by temporarily setting the `DISABLE_SPRING=1` environment variable and restarting your server.

To remove **spring** forever, here is the process we recommend:

1. `pkill -f spring`
2. Edit your Gemfile and comment out **spring** and **spring-watcher-listen**
3. `bin/spring binstub –-remove –-all`
