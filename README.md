# Welcome

## What is StimulusReflex?

**StimulusReflex offers an exciting new way to build modern, reactive, real-time apps with Ruby on Rails.** It eliminates the complexity imposed by full-stack frontend frameworks without abandoning a high performance reactive user experience. The goal is to help small teams do big things, faster than ever before. We invite you to explore **a fresh alternative to the Single Page App** \(SPA\).

{% hint style="warning" %}
StimulusReflex v3 has been released, and there are some big changes. **Rails 6+ and server-side session storage are now required.** See the Setup page for more information.

## Why should I use StimulusReflex?

Wouldn't it be great if you could **focus on your product** instead of the technical noise introduced by modern JavaScript. With StimulusReflex, you'll **ship projects faster, with smaller teams** and re-discover the joy of programming.

### Goals

* [x] Help small teams do big things... faster
* [x] Increase developer happiness
* [x] Facilitate simple, concise, and clear code
* [x] Integrate seamlessly with Ruby on Rails

## How we got here

**We love Rails.** Veterans of the framework remember the feeling of awe and disbelief after seeing David Heinemeier-Hansson's [Build a Blog in 15 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY) video. It didn't seem possible that web development could be so easy, productive, and fun. We're talking [exponential gains in developer efficiency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWEts0rlezA&t=3m23s) and happiness. Rails has become so successful that nearly every framework since has borrowed ideas, patterns, and features from it.

The landscape has changed a lot since those early days. Applications are more ambitious now. The pursuit of native UI speeds spawned a new breed of increasingly complex technologies. Modern **Single Page Apps** have pushed much of the server's responsibilities to the client. Unfortunately this new approach trades _a developer experience_ that was once **fun and productive** for an alternative of high complexity and only marginal gains.

**There must be a better way.**

## The revolution begins

In his 2018 ElixirConf keynote, [Chris McCord](https://twitter.com/chris_mccord) _\(creator of the_ [_Phoenix_](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) _framework for_ [_Elixir_](https://elixir-lang.org/)_\)_ introduced [LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view), an alternative to the SPA. His [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJzHq8ru0M) captures the same promise and excitement that Rails had in the early days.

We love Elixir and Phoenix. Elixir hits a sweet spot for people who want Rails-like conventions in a functional language. The community is terrific, but it's still small and comparatively niche.

Also, we just really enjoy using **Ruby and Rails**.

StimulusReflex was originally inspired by LiveView, but we are charting our own course. We hope to make building modern apps with Rails the most productive and enjoyable option available.

## Example apps

You can try a live StimulusReflex powered app right now:

* [StimulusReflex Expo](http://expo.stimulusreflex.com) - A growing collection of live examples showing different use cases alongside the source code required. **Start here!**
* [StimulusReflex TodoMVC](http://todomvc.stimulusreflex.com) - An implementation of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) using Ruby on Rails and StimulusReflex.
